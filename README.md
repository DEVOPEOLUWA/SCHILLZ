OVERVIEW:
DATE STARTED: 3RD AUGUST,2021
DATE COMPLETED: 12TH AUGUST,2021.
I developed the website to improve my frontendskills as it was one of my first MAJOR project.I used html,css and javascript
FEATURES:Home section
         About section
	 Services section
	 Signup/login section:Once the sign-up button is clicked,it directs you to a different page.
 It is scrollable,responsive and colorful website.The project is a demo-representation of a non-profit organisation that helps people to discover,
develop and monetize their skills well.I also made a good use of gradients and icons in the website.
To run this website  locally on your computer make sure you link the file to eachother thats if you changed the name.
you can also drop your issues,make a pull request....i'd gladly accept them.
